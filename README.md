## Introduction

English | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

MMSelfSup is an open source self-supervised representation learning toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5** or higher.


### Major features

- **Methods All in One**

  MMSelfsup provides state-of-the-art methods in self-supervised learning. For comprehensive comparison in all benchmarks, most of the pre-training methods are under the same setting.

- **Modular Design**

  MMSelfSup follows a similar code architecture of OpenMMLab projects with modular design, which is flexible and convenient for users to build their own algorithms.

- **Standardized Benchmarks**

  MMSelfSup standardizes the benchmarks including logistic regression, SVM / Low-shot SVM from linearly probed features, semi-supervised classification, object detection and semantic segmentation.

- **Compatibility**

  Since MMSelfSup adopts similar design of modulars and interfaces as those in other OpenMMLab projects, it supports smooth evaluation on downstream tasks with other OpenMMLab projects like object detection and segmentation.


## License

This project is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## ChangeLog

MMSelfSup **v0.5.0** was released with refactor in 16/12/2021.

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) for details and release history.

Differences between MMSelfSup and OpenSelfSup codebases can be found in [compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).
