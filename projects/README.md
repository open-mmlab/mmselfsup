# Welcome to Projects of MMSelfSup

In this folder, we welcome all contribution of self-supervised learning algorithms from community.

Here, these requirements, e.g. code standards, are not that strict as in core package. Thus, developers from the community can implement their algorithms much more easily and efficiently in MMSelfSup. We appreciate all contributions from community to make MMSelfSup greater.

We give some [instructions](./example_project/README.md) to implement your algorithms under `example_project` folder.

We also provide some documentation listed below:

- [Advanced Guides](https://mmselfsup.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/advanced_guides/index.html)

  The documentation of basic concepts and component customization.

- [Contribution Guide](https://mmselfsup.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/notes/contribution_guide.html)

  The guides for contribution to help new contributors.

- [Discussions](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmselfsup/discussions)

  Welcome to start discussion!
