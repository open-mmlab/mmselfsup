## Abstract

Contrastive learning has recently shown immense
potential in unsupervised visual representation learning. Existing studies in this track mainly focus on intra-image invariance learning. The learning typically uses rich intraimage transformations to construct positive pairs and then
maximizes agreement using a contrastive loss. The merits
of inter-image invariance, conversely, remain much less explored. One major obstacle to exploit inter-image invariance
is that it is unclear how to reliably construct inter-image
positive pairs, and further derive effective supervision from
them since no pair annotations are available. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study to better understand the role of inter-image invariance learning from three main constituting components: pseudo-label maintenance,
sampling strategy, and decision boundary design. To facilitate the study, we introduce a unified and generic framework that supports the integration of unsupervised intra- and
inter-image invariance learning. Through carefully-designed
comparisons and analysis, multiple valuable observations
are revealed: 1) online labels converge faster and perform
better than offline labels; 2) semi-hard negative samples are more reliable and unbiased than hard negative samples; 3) a
less stringent decision boundary is more favorable for interimage invariance learning. With all the obtained recipes, our final model, namely InterCLR, shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art intra-image invariance learning methods on multiple standard benchmarks. We hope this
work will provide useful experience for devising effective unsupervised inter-image invariance learning.

## Results and Models

In this page, we provide benchmarks as much as possible to evaluate our pre-trained models. If not mentioned, all models are pre-trained on ImageNet-1k dataset. Here, we use MoCov2-InterCLR as an example. More models and results are coming soon.

### Classification

#### VOC SVM / Low-shot SVM

The **Best Layer** indicates that the best results are obtained from which layers feature map. For example, if the **Best Layer** is **feature3**, its best result is obtained from the second stage of ResNet (1 for stem layer, 2-5 for 4 stage layers).

Besides, k=1 to 96 indicates the hyper-parameter of Low-shot SVM.

#### ImageNet Linear Evaluation

The **Feature1 - Feature5** don't have the GlobalAveragePooling, the feature map is pooled to the specific dimensions and then follows a Linear layer to do the classification. Please refer to [resnet50_mhead_linear-8xb32-steplr-90e_in1k](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmselfsup/blob/master/configs/benchmarks/classification/imagenet/resnet50_mhead_linear-8xb32-steplr-90e_in1k.py) for details of config.
